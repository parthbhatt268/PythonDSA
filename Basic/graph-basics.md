# 🕸️ Graph Basics

## DFS and BFS — Overview

- **DFS (Depth First Search)** → uses a **stack**, like **pre-order traversal** in a tree.
- **BFS (Breadth First Search)** → uses a **queue**, like **level-order traversal** in a tree.

## Types of Graphs

- **Directed**, **Undirected** graph
- **Cyclic** (even one cycle makes the whole graph cyclic), **Acyclic** graph
- **Directed cyclic** graph, **Directed acyclic graph (DAG)**
- **Connected** and **Disconnected** graph
  - In a **directed** graph, you might not be able to go in the reverse direction, which can make it **disconnected**.
- **Complete** graph — every node is connected to all other nodes
- **Weighted**, **Unweighted** graph

## Graph Representation

**Two common ways to represent a graph:**

1. **Adjacency Matrix**  
   Used when the graph is **dense** (close to complete).
   - **Time Complexity:** `O(V^2)`
   - **Space Complexity:** `O(V^2)`
   - Drawback: Uses extra space to represent **no edge** (e.g., storing `0`).

2. **Adjacency List**  
   Used when the graph is **sparse**.
   - **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
   - **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
   - In the **worst case** (complete graph), TC and SC approach `O(V^2)`.

## Backtracking & Branch and Bound

- **Backtracking (DFS)**
- **Branch and Bound (BFS)**
- **State space tree**
- **Bounding function** (mostly used in BFS)

Backtracking uses a **state-space diagram** (a tree-like structure) and is handy when we need **all possible ways** of something.

## 🌲 Tree Basics

- For a tree with **n nodes**, there are **n−1 edges**; **no loops**.
- There is always a **root**, and each child has **one parent** only.
- **Every tree is a graph**, but **not every graph is a tree**.
