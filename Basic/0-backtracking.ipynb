    "# SO you will be gieven an arrya and you have to find and return all the poissble sombination of  permuatiosn of it\n",
    "# So we start form the base case like lets say there were zero element what is the permutation blank subarray,\n",
    "# then for just one number whats the soution subarray with one value in it.\n",
    "# then for every next big array you say like okay we inseert number in the front and the middle and the back\n",
    "# Like for array input [2,3] --output--> [2,3] and [3,2] (one is staruaght and one is reversed)\n",

    "# so in put threee you had [2,3] and you just inseted 1 like at start, middle and then end, same with next three [3,2] you insterted\n",
