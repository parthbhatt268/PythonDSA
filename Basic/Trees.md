DFS - Stack, Pre-order traversal in Tree,
BFS - Queue, Level order travel in Tree ,

Articulation point - this is the point(node) in grpah whic if removed will break the whole grpah in 2 or more componenet. This could be like a single point on failure in system a netwrok etc.

So to avois this we have BiConnected compoenent this in simple terms is like having an exra edge whcih will remove the arciualtion point boz now we have two differnt route if this articulation point is gone.

Back Tracking (DFS), Barnch and Bound (BFS), State space tree, Bounding fucntion

mcolouring decsion problem (decising wheather 3 or lets say 4 colour are enough to color the grpah with consdition that no adjecent node will have same colour)
mclouring optimization problem (min how many color is required to color the gprah with same condition)

Backtracking in htis we use statepsace diagram that tree liek looking diagram to solve it and then we use back tracking when we have to find things like 'ALL poisble way of somehting'

Hamiltation cycle - its a cycle in graog that you can vist eveyr node once and come bakc to the node where you started from, then it is called as hamitation cycle

and if you want a Articulation point in the grpah, or PENDANT node(child nodes) thne in that case Hamiltanion cycelc is not possible.
